# AdaptiveFEM

## Introduction

My thesis presents a software project that solves the Laplace and Helmholtz equations for two-dimensional electromagnetic problems using the finite element method. The software allows users to define, solve, and visualize the physical characteristics of different materials and domains. The software also provides a graphical user interface and a user experience that are easy to use and understand. The software is implemented using the WPF framework and C# language and uses external libraries such as Gnuplot and Matplotlib for plotting. The software can be used for educational and research purposes, as well as for designing and analyzing capacitors, waveguides, and other electromagnetic devices.

## Features

- Finite Element Method Solver: The software implements a finite element method (FEM) solver to solve the Laplace and Helmholtz equations for two-dimensional electromagnetic problems. Users can define different materials and domains, set boundary conditions, and obtain numerical solutions.

- Graphical User Interface (GUI): The software provides an intuitive GUI for users to interact with the solver. Users can input problem parameters, visualize results, and adjust settings easily through the interface.

- Material Properties: Users can specify material properties (such as conductivity, permittivity, and permeability) for different regions within the domain. This flexibility allows for modeling a wide range of electromagnetic scenarios.

- Visualization Tools: The software integrates with external libraries (such as Gnuplot and matplotlib) to create visualizations of electric fields, potential distributions, and other relevant quantities. These plots aid in understanding the physics of the problem.

- Educational and Research Use: The software is suitable for educational purposes, helping students learn about FEM and electromagnetic theory. Researchers can also utilize it for analyzing capacitors, waveguides, and other electromagnetic devices.

- Computational Efficiency: The solver is optimized for performance, allowing users to solve complex problems efficiently. Parallelization techniques and adaptive mesh refinement contribute to faster computations.

- Productivity Features: The software includes features like automatic mesh generation, result export (e.g., CSV files), and batch processing. These streamline the workflow and enhance productivity for users.

- Cross-Platform Compatibility: Developed using the WPF framework and C# language, the software is compatible with Windows systems. Its modular design allows for potential future extensions or adaptations.
